# welcome to my digital lab notebook

## about me

I'm an entrepreneur-engineer, researcher, musician, and linguaphile. I am co-founder and CTO at **Olibra ([Bond Home](https://bondhome.io))**, where I lead a team building next-generation user experiences for smart home. I've done research in the past in causal inference (think of it as the less trendy little sister of AI Interpretability), and insofar as I have research interests at the moment, I am toying with:

 - technical approaches to AI safety, especially via interpretability
 - how character-level transformer models may learn morphemes and their meanings
 - training through self-play, in games and mathematics

You can find my [senior thesis on physical model theory](assets/Merck-Physical_Model_Theory-2010.pdf) from my undergraduate work.

Otherwise I spend my time doodling on guitar, taking friends foraging, ever so gradually learning Latin, and teaching kids to solder and code.

My intent with this site is to share occasional writeups related to work, research, and adjacent. Try the sidebar menu.
