# welcome to my digital lab notebook

## about me

I'm an entrepreneur-engineer, researcher, engineer, technologist, musician, and linguaphile. 

I am co-founder and CTO at **Olibra ([Bond Home](https://bondhome.io))**, where I lead a team building next-generation user experiences for smart home.

My primary research interest at this time is AI interpretability, specifically how character-level language models learn morphemes and their meanings.

Otherwise I spend my time covering sad girl music, taking friends foraging, ever so gradually learning Latin, and teaching kids to solder and code.
